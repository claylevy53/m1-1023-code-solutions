## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?

A loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met, allowing for efficient repetition and automation of tasks in a program

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?

The condition expression in a loop determines whether the loop should continue executing or terminate. It is evaluated before each iteration, and if it evaluates to true, the loop continues; otherwise, it stops

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?

An "iteration" in the context of loops refers to a single execution of the loop's code block. Each iteration represents one cycle through the loop

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?

The condition expression of a while loop is evaluated before each iteration of the loop, and if it's true, the loop continues; otherwise, it terminates

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

The initialization expression of a for loop is evaluated once, at the beginning, before the first iteration of the loop

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

The condition expression of a for loop is evaluated before the start of each iteration. If it's true, the loop continues; otherwise, it stops

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

The final expression of a for loop is evaluated after each iteration, typically used for updating loop control variables

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?

The break keyword is used to exit a loop prematurely, regardless of whether the loop's condition is true or false

- What does the `++` increment operator do?

The ++ increment operator is used to increase the value of a variable by 1. It's often used in loops to increment loop control variables

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?

You can iterate through the keys of an object using a for...in loop by using the variable declared in the loop as the index of the object itself. Such as object[variableDefinedinLoop]
