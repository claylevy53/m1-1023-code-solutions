## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?

a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or a set of tasks. Functions are used to encapsulate logic, promote code reusability, and make code more organized

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.

Function Name: This is the identifier for the function and is used to call it later.

Parameters: These are placeholders for values that the function expects as input. Parameters are optional and can be used to pass data into the function.

Function Body: This is the block of code enclosed in curly braces {} that contains the instructions or statements that the function executes when called.

Return Statement (optional): This part specifies the value that the function should return after it completes its execution. Not all functions have a return statement.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.

A function call is when you invoke a function to execute its code. The parts of a function call include:

Function Name: The name of the function you want to call.
Arguments: These are the actual values or expressions you pass to the function as input. They correspond to the parameters defined in the function definition.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

Function Definition: Specifies how a function works, its name, parameters, and code body.

Function Call: Invokes the function, providing actual values (arguments) for its parameters and executes the code within the function body.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

Parameter: A parameter is a variable declared in the function definition. It acts as a placeholder for the values that will be passed to the function when it is called. Parameters are part of the function signature.

Argument: An argument is the actual value or expression passed into a function when it is called. Arguments are provided when invoking the function and are assigned to the corresponding parameters.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?

Function parameters are useful because they allow you to make functions more versatile and adaptable. By using parameters, you can create functions that can work with different data without having to modify the function's code

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?

Value Return: The primary effect of a return statement is to specify the value that the function should produce as its result

Function Termination: When a return statement is encountered in a function, the function immediately stops executing, and control is returned to the point where the function was called.
