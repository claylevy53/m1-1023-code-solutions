## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the difference between an ordered list and an unordered list in HTML?

Ordered List (<ol>): An ordered list is used to create a list of items that should be displayed in a specific numerical or alphabetical order. Each item in an ordered list is preceded by a number or letter (or other ordered marker) to indicate its position in the list

Unordered List (<ul>): An unordered list is used to create a list of items that do not have a specific numerical or alphabetical order. Each item in an unordered list is typically preceded by a bullet point or some other type of unordered marker.

- Is an HTML list a block element or an inline element?

In HTML, lists are typically block-level elements. Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width of their container. This means that by default, list items (<li>) within ordered or unordered lists will also be displayed as block-level elements.
