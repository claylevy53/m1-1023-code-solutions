## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are arrays used for?

Arrays are data structures used in programming to store and organize collections of values. They are commonly used for storing multiple related values of the same data type, such as a list of numbers or strings. Arrays provide a way to access and manipulate these values efficiently.

- Describe array literal notation.

Use the square brackets [] to create an array and separate each item with a comma [1,2,3,4] or ["red","yellow"]

- How are arrays different from "plain" objects?

Arrays are ordered collections of values where each value has a numeric index starting from 0. They are typically used for storing lists of items and have built-in methods for working with such lists

Objects store data as key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be of any data type. They are used for storing structured data and are not inherently ordered like arrays

- What number represents the first index of an array?

Zero!

- What is the `length` property of an array?

The length property of an array is a built-in property that returns the number of elements in the array

- How do you calculate the last index of an array?

To calculate the last index of an array, you can use the formula arrayName.length - 1. Since array indices start at 0, subtracting 1 from the length gives you the index of the last element
