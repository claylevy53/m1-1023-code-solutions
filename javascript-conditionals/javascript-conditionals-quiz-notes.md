## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Give 6 examples of comparison operators.

== (equal to), != (not equal to), === (strict equal to), !== (strict not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than).

- What data type do comparison expressions evaluate to?

Comparison expressions evaluate to a Boolean data type (true or false).

- What is the purpose of an `if` statement?

The purpose of an if statement is to conditionally execute a block of code based on a specified condition

- Is `else` required in order to use an `if` statement?

No, else is not required to use an if statement. You can use an if statement by itself to execute code when a condition is true.

- Describe the syntax (structure) of an `if` statement.

The if keyword: The statement starts with the if keyword, which indicates that you are defining a condition to be checked.

Parentheses ( and ): Inside the parentheses, you place the condition that you want to evaluate. This condition should be an expression that results in a Boolean value (true or false).

Curly braces { and }: After the closing parenthesis, you enclose a block of code within curly braces. This block of code is executed if the condition inside the parentheses evaluates to true.

- What are the three logical operators?

The three logical operators are && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT).

- How do you compare two different expressions in the same condition?

To compare two different expressions in the same condition, you can use logical operators like && (AND) or || (OR) to combine multiple conditions.

- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?

The purpose of a switch statement is to provide a more concise way to handle multiple possible conditions or values and execute different code blocks based on those conditions or values.

- Is a `default` clause required in order to use a `switch` statement?

No, a default clause is not required in order to use a switch statement. It is optional and is executed if none of the case conditions match.
